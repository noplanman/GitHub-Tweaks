## Details

Here's what this script does for you / adds to the GitHub website.

### Commit Ref Links

When viewing a PR, there is a short summary text similar to this at the top:

- **user2** wants to merge 8 commits into `user1:master` from `user2:branch`

The `user1:master` and `user2:branch` placeholders are now links to the respective branches.

(this applies to all `user:branch` placeholders wherever they appear)

### Pull Info Links

On the dashboard, the pull info fields are now linked to the PR's "Files changed" tab for quick access.

### Toggleable File Diffs

When viewing the changed files of a PR, branch comparison or a single commit, you can now collapse and expand the files by clicking the individual file headers.
Alternatively, you can collapse and expand all at the same time by clicking one of the new buttons at the top.

### Toggleable Comments

When viewing a conversation of an issue or PR, you can now collapse and expand the comments by clicking the individual comment headers.
Alternatively, you can collapse and expand all at the same time by clicking one of the new buttons in the topmost comment header.
For hidden comments, the first part of the content gets added to the comment header as a tooltip.
